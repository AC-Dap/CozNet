CozNet
----
CozNet is a distributed causal profiler, inspired by Coz. Made for the final project for CS 2610.

## Building
To build CozNet, simply run
```
make dcuz
```

## Running
CozNet is loaded and ran as a shared library with `LD_PRELOAD`. Additionally, it requires three configuration variables:
- `DCUZ_MODULE`: The name of the ELF binary that contains the line of code to profile.
- `DCUZ_OFFSET`: The offset of the line inside the ELF binary.
- `DCUZ_SPEEDUP`: A number between 0 and 1 corresponding to how much the line should be sped up by.

The module and offset of a line can all be generated by `generate_line_mappings.py`. Additionally, running CozNet for every line in a source file is automated by `run_dcuz_experiments.py`.
